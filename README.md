<b>Name Generation Feature</b>

In our Flutter app, we've implemented a unique "Name Generation" feature by incorporating the "english_words" package. By adding this package to the dependencies in our <b>pubspec.yaml</b> file, we've seamlessly integrated it into our app. This package allows us to effortlessly generate creative and meaningful English word combinations.

<b>Key Features:</b>

<b>Word Combination Generation:</b> With the "english_words" package, we can generate captivating and imaginative word combinations by concatenating two English words. This feature is perfect for generating unique names, titles, or any other textual content.

<b>ListView for Scrolling:</b> We've designed our app with a user-friendly ListView, enabling smooth scrolling through the generated word combinations. This intuitive design ensures a delightful user experience.

<b>Word Likability:</b> As an added bonus, our app provides users with the option to like and save their favorite word combinations. This feature allows users to curate a list of words that resonate with them or hold personal significance.
